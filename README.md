Title- Implementation of visualization techniques


Data visualization provides an important suite of tools for identifying a qualitative understanding. This can be helpful when we try to explore the dataset and extract some information to know about a dataset and can help with identifying patterns, corrupt data, outliers, and much more.

Data visualization is defined as a graphical representation that contains the information and the data.

By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization techniques provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

In this ,  will be discussing four such libraries.
1.Matplotlib
2.Seaborn

After installing Matplotlib, letâ€™s see the most commonly used plots using this library.
a.Hist
b.Scatter Plot
c.Box plot
d.Count plot
e.Pie chart
